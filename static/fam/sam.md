My name is Salvatore D'Angelo III but everyone calls me Sam. I grew up in Trenton, NJ. Graduated with a double major in PolySci and Global Studies from [Rider University](https://rider.edu/) just in time to realize that I liked the theory of politics a lot more than the practice. So I thought...might as well go play some music.

My friend convinced me to check out a “really cool” open mic at a local [bar](https://www.facebook.com/trentonsocial) in my hometown. It was and I went every week, started waiting tables, making drinks, became a part of a beautifully underground arts community, co-founded a [production studio](https://sixtomidnight.productions/), and met my wife.

We had two lovelies, Phoenix and Juniper. Our dog, Koda, is grumpily protective of each new addition.

Inspired by #generativeart and looking to evolve my company, I came upon The [Processing Foundation](https://processing.org/), started slow and kept iterating daily until programming became an insatiable pursuit. Coupling art and code led to an interest in web design and development. I’m now obsessed with solving my clients’ problems and designing responsive solutions that scale.

## Country Commons hath Come

I am so happy for them. I am so thrilled for us. There are a lot of important memories here. I got married here. My two babies were born here. They're actively growing here. The walls have grown rather tight from frustration, and I've grown. My legs have been resting but now they're restless. It's time to go. We are ready because being ready means having no other choice but what's ahead. And the day is finally upon us.

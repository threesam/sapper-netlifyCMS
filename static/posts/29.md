I'm 29 years old. I had a baby this year. I became a web developer. I stretched and realized the room was too cramped to allow me the relief I crave. I need help, but I always did. We all do. This exercise of writing for 30 days has been part transformative and part chore but I'm doing my best. We all try our best. Often it's good enough. Hopefully, often is good enough for me.

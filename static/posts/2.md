What does it mean to have a singular, focused goal? Sometimes, it means entertaining ideas that would not otherwise generate any viable form of entertainment; conforming every lived experience to the service of that goal; trimming the fat of your recreation steak so that your heart can pump smarter, not harder. A **dose** of realism, sometimes, can be enough to invigorate the idealist's hustle. How many doses can we withstand before the grinding of the present diminishes the future's allure? A lot. And, perhaps, even more.

Our first Christmas tree was trimmed last night and has, so far, remained in tact. Has our caffeine fast?

**Our first Christmas tree is in the middle of my parent-in-law's living room. We are surviving together, we thrive together. What is my purpose, she asked all day? What's my type, my enneagram? What difference would it make if I were different? Because, I'm not. I'm the way that I am and some parts are specific to me, while others relate to others.**

**What about a blog that had custom content types that nested social media bits that eventually got serverless functioned out when the post was posted? Gimme that automagic crossposting, please. Nah mean.**

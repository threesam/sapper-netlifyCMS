### Cancel it

We don't need systems that don't work for us.

> I had a full scholarship through grants, halfway through college our governor stripped one of the larger grants by 90%. My choices were to either drop out or take out loans. My grades didn’t matter, my circumstances didn’t matter. There is no incentive for students to excel in a system that rewards money over merit.

I wrote this on a petition to cancel student debt today. Also today, I learned a bunch of math online, for free, and of better quality than the entirety of my private school education (not free). The irony of explosive progress is so uncomfortable for those born before the boom. I knew that the world was rapidly shifting faster than ever, that my degree would be obsolete as soon as I got it, but I got it because "that paper opens doors." And it did? But there's actually a lot of doors in the world, and college opened hardly any. 

Society needs us informed—our environment suffers when we aren't. We need education, but as a trade for autonomy? C'mon. I'm just trying to get someone to tell everyone that I know enough to matter. Don't make my future pay for it. Don't make the future pay for it. Make it work for us.

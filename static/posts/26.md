Friday’s are hard when you’re looking for a job. I know there won’t be significant movement until the workweek begins, so weekends are the new fever pitch of my anxiety and Mondays my savior. We all crave stability and certainty and i’m willing to bang my head on a keyboard until i get it. Even though I love what I’m doing, extending that love to meet the bitterness of the world is a tougher than scraping forgotten gum off the bottom of bar stools. Cheers!

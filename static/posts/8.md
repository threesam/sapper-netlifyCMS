# *\*inhales poorly\**

*TIL* breathing is hard...to do right. Mostly because it's ubiquitously taken for granted in American society; I've never really put any thought into how to breathe effectively—except for that one summer I had the privilege of swimming in a pool everyday and kept my eyes open in chlorinated water and pushing my lungs to the limit (PR: 3 minutes, just saying). But I definitely was a mouth breather then too. Turns out, the nose has a vital  job: to strip pollutants, pressurize and process the air that’s ultimately sent to our lungs, among other things. No thanks, I’d prefer to avoid early entropy and upgrade to premium breath. And since I can’t keep my damn mouth shut at night, I’m taping it shut because that's a third of my life spent doing life wrong. 

*TIL* the goop podcast has too strong a hold over me. Either they are just dropping bomb content week after week or my ties to reality are weaker than my weak, no-nose-inhaling lungs. Lot of guilt caused by goop today, like c’mon Gwyneth.

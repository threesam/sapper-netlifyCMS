this morning was the medical system on full display. nina not fully understanding my interpretation of the hyper focused words of her attending nurse practitioner. i understood how medicare only covered 80% now, that bureaucratic pharmacists need YOU to get in touch with whoever they say is tying their hands. your pain is minimized, i’ve seen this before.

then, during nap time, we got into country commons.

shortly thereafter, i got fairly compensated for future hard work so we bought diapers the day before payday.

what are we going to do? 🐕‍🦺

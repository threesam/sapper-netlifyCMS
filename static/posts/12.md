I hurried us all out of the house. We needed fresh air desperately as the indoors had grown stale. With a dog, a toddler in my sights, and an infant strapped to my chest we blew through the door to see that our neighbors car was parked in the middle of the lot. 

Their power-steering was not functioning, and they were trying to move the car into another spot. The neighbor, who often drops off donuts and mint, asked if I could help. I told Phoenix to hold Koda, got in, grabbed the wheel, and maneuvered a heavy car one spot over. Juniper was pissed throughout, and Phoenix thought I was leaving her forever. But it was done and we left.

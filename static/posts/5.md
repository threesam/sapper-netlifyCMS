# consume

I see children burning through their fuel reserves without care or bother. every. damn. day. They consume the richness of the world around them, expel magic, inhale calories, and sleep. The present tense personified.

I am a consumer. Coerced by experience, my movements require redundant thoughts to function. The sight of steak makes me salivate even without tasting the taste in a decade. Maybe because advertising in the information age is uncomfortably persuasive. How many pill pushers are there? Am I sad? Yeah, probably, sometimes—when I dwell almost specifically on things that I cannot change.

I am consumed. It’s happening eventually, always has been. Might as well ride a present pony into space—every single space reserved for stale notions of purpose. I am not who I was this morning. I’ve learned to want better and bigger, to live for the next 5 minutes.

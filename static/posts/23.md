# anticipation

weâ€™re gonna be solo living so sooner than soon. how can i prepare? how can i wait? i have a dimmed fire begging to be attended, to be filled with fuel and a new trail to blaze. i need something different, insatiably. desperation feels familiar but really frustration is the real lingererr eww. 

go away.

### What's in the box?!?

Memories are echoes triggered by familiar patterns in the now. Amplified by ties to strong emotions, I remember my previous self. I see emotions on others for the first time that I've worn always. What felt like it anyway. Once I start my memory machine, I can't help surfing the synaptic waves.

Okay, enough of that. How do I extract my needs from my experience. What type of human do I want to be when I face resistance and problem solve?

#### I practice ___ engagement

* loving
* playful
* innovative
* transparent
* resilient

There is no good reason not to practice, save fear of self-disappointment. And I heard once our fear is really just suppressed excitement, human work that needs to be met head on. I want to be afraid and vulnerable and expansive in my faux constricted space. Can I be big without stepping on others? 

Seeing as how life ain’t a competition, we really should all hope to be big together. Maybe I long for the acceptance by or creation of community. Maybe I’ve always had it and took it for granted, or naming it means it can be taken away. Yeah, that’s feels wasteful. I’d rather be fear-forward in the service of progress than have a busted compass that points nowhere. Practice begins in the now.

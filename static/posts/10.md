## Hi, Identity...and Crisis

What do I want to be? In the tech industry, yes. At an un-cookie-cutter company that allows me to wear all of the lovely hats, definitely. That's hardly specific, and it barely makes any sense. I want to make sense to the passerby, to myself. 

> Do you want to be a designer?..by your portfolio, I'm not sure what job you are looking for...you seem like the kind of person who's trying to make their own job.

Doesn't matter whether it's coding, music, or parenting; I need to be able to answer what I learned from a project. *What challenges* did I face? *What tools* did I use to solve them? Can what I did *help others*? Because others help me all the time. Search engines feed me a chaotic, often angry, progressive blueprint for the future. Friends offer their unique experience to guide me through the present. It is a privilege to have access to the internet and kind, like-minded people. I have much to be grateful for and much more work still left to do.

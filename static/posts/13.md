This here my favorite number. That is all?

Today, my love hyped up this mashed potato pie that she was going to make. She boiled her potatoes and then came into the living room from the kitchen to tell me: "I need you to go peel the potatoes." But they had just been sitting in a boiling bubble bath for the past 45 minutes; I knew that a challenge had presented itself and I chose to rise to the occassion. My tips were singed, the counter-top a mess, but I peeled every one of those lava balls.

I will not be defeated by heated tots. At least not today.
